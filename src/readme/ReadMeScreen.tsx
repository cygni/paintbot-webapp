          Your mission is to write the best Paint Bot and survive within the game world. We have prepared bindings in
          multiple languages for you to make it really easy to get started. All the boring stuff concerning
          server-client communication, message parsing and event handling is already implemented.

          The game progresses through Game Ticks. For each Game Tick participating Paint Bots have to choose an action
          (and they have to do it fast, response is expected within 250ms). Actions are defined by a direction to move
          the bot in. A bot head may move UP, DOWN, RIGHT or LEFT. A bot may also use a power-up to EXPLODE and cover a
          larger area around it in paint.

        <PaperRow>
          On every Game Tick each Paint Bot receives the current Map. The map contains the positions of all the objects
          in the map.

          Below are listed the currently implemented (and up to date) language bindings. Each project has a Readme file
          that explains how to get going.
